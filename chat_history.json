The bottom tab bar provides quick access to the five main sections of your app!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "506ca2b00b5f1a4fd5524a014fbf4ca4c4532a40", "message": "feat: Implement new tab structure and screens", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T21:56:10Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/map.tsx", "app/(tabs)/messages.tsx", "app/(tabs)/notifications.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "app/(tabs)/explore.tsx", "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "app/(tabs)/weather.tsx", "app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx", "components/FloatingTabBar.tsx"], "update_number": 3, "parent_commit_id": "354d526f83fac19d6b8a62bacfe8ee4e018a0dfa"}], "timestamp": "2025-11-03T21:49:49Z"}, {"role": "user", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "the preview is showing errors"}]}, {"role": "assistant", "content": [{"type": "text", "text": "It seems like you're encountering errors in the app preview.

In the meantime, here are some general steps you can take to try and resolve the errors:\n\n*   **Check the Expo logs:** Use the `read_runtime_logs` tool to inspect the Expo development server logs for any error messages or warnings. This can often provide valuable clues about the cause of the problem.\n*   **Review recent code changes:** If the errors started appearing after you made some changes to the code, carefully review those changes to see if you can identify any potential issues.\n*   **Restart the Expo development server:** Sometimes, simply restarting the Expo development server can resolve transient issues.\n*   **Clear the Expo cache:** Try running `expo start -c` to clear the Expo cache and restart the development server.\n*   **Check for dependency issues:** Make sure all your project dependencies are installed correctly and that there are no version conflicts. You can try running `npm install` or `yarn install` to reinstall the dependencies.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-11-03T21:57:58.562797"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you fix the errors in the preview.
